Can [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) be used to make a game or game engine?  Here are some experiments to try to answer that question...

### Zark

A silly Zork-like adventure game engine prototype. Supports moving between areas and picking up and dropping items. Score points by visiting all the areas. (Use editor hints to toggle between editing and playing the game.)

### Bogue

A bogus ['roguelike'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game....

Using these [notes](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/) and associated [code](https://github.com/munificent/hauberk) by Bob Nystrom for map generation.

### Consoul

An attempt to make a sort of REPL or console with MPS.

### Zombo

Experiments with making the editor less editable.

### Gamification Design Framework

So far the only thing I've found related to games and MPS is this research project:
