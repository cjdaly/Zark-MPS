Can [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) be used to make a game or game engine?  Here are some experiments to try to answer that question...

### Zark

A silly Zork-like adventure game engine prototype. Supports moving between areas and picking up and dropping items. Score points by visiting all the areas.

### Consoul

An attempt to make a sort of REPL or console with MPS.

### Zombo

Experiments with making the editor less editable.

### Gamification Design Framework

So far the only thing I've found related to games and MPS is this research project:
